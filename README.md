SSDS Data Analysis and SVM Fit

This project analyzes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset, which is over 10,000 data points spread across 18 columns.  
It creates visuals to understand the data distribution, and then creates a SVM algorithm to classify objects into three celestial bodies: Galaxies, Stars, and Quasars.
